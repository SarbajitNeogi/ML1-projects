1. Rock vs Mine Prediction
Project Name: Rock vs Mine Prediction

Description:
This project aims to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The dataset consists of sonar readings with features characterizing the signals. The goal is to train a machine learning model to accurately predict whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine.

Files:

rock_vs_mine_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
sonar_data.csv: Dataset containing sonar readings and corresponding labels (rock or mine).
